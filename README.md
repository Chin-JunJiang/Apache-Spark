# Apache-Spark

Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed processing system which utilizes in-memory caching, and optimized query execution for fast analytic queries against data of any size. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Spark is developed as a unified engine where it comes packaged with higher-level libraries, including support for a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames, pandas API on Spark for pandas workloads, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Structured Streaming for stream processing.

This repository contains Apache Spark based projects in Python. A comprehensive explanation each project and it's specifications are within the project's directory.
